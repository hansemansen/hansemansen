ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kenneth
I'm a computer science (Datamatiker) student based in Aarhus, Denmark, with a background in education and a passion for building software that makes sense to real users.
Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, collaboration, and writing clear, structured code.

This GitHub showcases some of the projects Iâ€™ve built as Iâ€™ve learned â€” from simple web apps to game logic and backend systems.
