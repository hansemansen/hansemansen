## Hi there 👋
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=hansemansen)

Datamatiker (AP Degree in Computer Science) graduate based in Aarhus, Denmark. 
I enjoy building practical software in real codebases, and I care about clear structure, maintainability, and collaboration.

This GitHub contains selected learning projects — small to medium apps and game logic — that reflect how I work and how I think.

Highlighted projects:
🎲 Online Multiplayer Yatzy — Real-time web game (Socket.io) with a modular MVC structure.
🐦 BackYard Birds — iOS app for bird watchers (Swift + Firebase). (Public/Private: add note)
🎯 Physics-based iOS game — Angry Birds-style mechanics (Private repo — demo available).

Core technologies:
C# / .NET • SQL • Umbraco (Razor) • Git • HTML/CSS

Also worked with:
JavaScript • Node.js • Firebase • Swift • Java

If you’d like to see more (e.g., non-public work from internships/real projects), I’m happy to walk through it.
