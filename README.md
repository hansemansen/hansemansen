## Hi there 👋
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=hansemansen)

I'm a computer science (Datamatiker) student based in Aarhus, Denmark, with a background in education and a passion for building software that makes sense to real users.
I’m driven by curiosity, collaboration, and writing clear, structured code.

This GitHub showcases some of the projects I’ve built as I’ve learned — from simple web apps to game logic and backend systems.

🎯 Angry Birds-style game for iOS
Physics-based iOS game where players launch birds at structures and targets.

🎲 Online Multiplayer Yatzy
Real-time web game using Socket.io and Pug, built with a modular MVC setup.

🐦 BackYard Birds – iOS App for bird watchers.
Log, view, and filter bird-sightings with map integration and user authentication. Built with Swift and Firebase.
