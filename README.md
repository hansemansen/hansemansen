I'm a computer science (Datamatiker) graduate based in Aarhus, Denmark, with a background in education and a passion for building software that makes sense to real users.
I’m driven by curiosity, collaboration, and writing clear, structured code.

Physics-based iOS game where players launch birds at structures and targets.

🎲 Online Multiplayer Yatzy

🐦 BackYard Birds – iOS App for bird watchers.
